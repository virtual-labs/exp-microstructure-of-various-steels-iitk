### About the Experiment 

Carbon steels by far find the maximum use in industries and daily life. Referring to the iron-carbon phase diagram, shown in Figure 1, 
compositions with C content less than 2.1 wt% C fall under the purview of steel and all compositions beyond 2.1 wt% to 6.7 wt% C is considered cast iron.
