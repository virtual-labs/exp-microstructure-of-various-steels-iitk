Carbon steels by far find the maximum use in industries and daily life. Referring to the iron-carbon phase diagram, shown in Figure 1, compositions with C content less than 2.1 wt% C fall under the purview of steel and all compositions beyond 2.1 wt% to 6.7 wt% C is considered cast iron. The right extreme (6.7 wt% C) forms cementite, which is an intermetallic compounds orthorhombic crystal structure.<br><br>

In the Fe rich portion of Fe-C phase diagram (Figure 2), we see several phases. Austenite, ferrite and cementite.  we observe a temperature minimum in austenitic phase with 0.76wt% C and 723<sup>0</sup>C, it forms single phase austenite. Austenite has high solubility of carbon (max. 2.11wt% at about 1150<sup>0</sup>C). On cooling such an alloy below 723<sup>0</sup>C (for the composition 0.8 C wt%), the alloy undergoes eutectoid transformation forming two phases, ferrite(<i>α</i>) and cementite, simultaneously. This structure is known as pearlite, which consists of alternate lamellae of <i>α</i> and Fe<sub>3</sub>C. <br>

Steels having composition less than 0.8 wt% C (known as hypo eutectoid steels) has primary <i>α</i> and pearlite in the microstructure because on cooling such a steel from <i>γ</i> region, it forms <i>α</i> first until the composition of the remaining <i>γ</i> reaches 0.8 wt% at temperature of 723<sup>0</sup>C, and this austenite undergoes eutectoid transformation. Therefore, microstructure of hypo eutectoid steels consists of proeutectoid <i>α</i> with lamellar pearlite in varying proportions depending on the alloy composition. Similarly, Fe-C alloy compositions more than 0.8wt% C are termed as hypereutectoid steels. The microstructure of such steels consists of pro eutectoid Fe<sub>3</sub>C with lamellar pearlite.<br>
The microstructure of steel depends on heat treatment conditions. If we heat a steel with 0.7wt% C to 950<sup>0</sup>C and suddenly quench the steel in water (or brine solution), the steel becomes very hard. Quenching of steel is the rapid cooling from a suitably elevated temperature. This is because,<i>γ</i> transforms to a new phase called martensite, which is a metastable phase with body center tetragonal crystal structure. Martensite has lath shaped morphology, which are internally twinned. The microstructures show twin laths in different orientations. The most important alloy steel is stainless steel. Stainless steels are stainless as they have minimum 11.5wt% Cr, which forms very thin, protective, adherent, and stable oxide (preferably Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) film on the surface. This film is continuous, impervious and passive to stop further reaction between steels and atmosphere. Stainless steels can be of different types depending on the microstructure: ferrite, austenitic, martensitic, duplex types. We will study 18wt% Cr and 8wt% Ni, famously known as 18-8 austentic stainless steel. The microstructure shows grains of austenite.
