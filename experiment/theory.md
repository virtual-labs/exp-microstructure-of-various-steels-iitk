Carbon steels by far find the maximum use in industries and daily life. Referring to the iron-carbon phase diagram, shown in Figure 1, compositions with C content less than 2.1 wt% C fall under the purview of steel and all compositions beyond 2.1 wt% to 6.7 wt% C is considered cast iron. The right extreme (6.7 wt% C) forms cementite, which is an intermetallic compounds orthorhombic crystal structure.<br><br>

In the Fe-rich portion of the iron-C phase diagram (Figure 2), we see several phases. Austenite, ferrite and cementite. Austenite is a Face-centered cubic (FCC) structure that forms minima at 0.76 wt% C and 723<sup>0</sup>C in its single-phase form. Austenite has a high solubility of carbon (max. 2.11wt% at about 1150<sup>0</sup>C). <br>
On cooling such an alloy below 723<sup>0<s/up>C (for the composition 0.8 C wt%), the alloy undergoes eutectoid transformation, forming two phases, ferrite(<i>α</i>) and cementite, simultaneously. This transformation is called the Eutectoid reaction. Because of the diffusion-driven process, the two phases form a lamellar structure of ferrite and cementite, known as the pearlite colony. <br>

Steels having composition less than 0.8 wt% C (known as hypoeutectoid steels) have primary <i>α</i> and pearlite in the microstructure. On cooling such a steel from <i>γ</i> (austenitic region), it forms <i>α</i> (carbon deficient composition)  first until the composition of the remaining <i>γ</i> reaches 0.8 wt%. As it reaches a temperature of 723<sup>0</sup>C, this austenite undergoes eutectoid transformation. Therefore, microstructure of hypoeutectoid steels consists of proeutectoid <i>α</i> with lamellar pearlite. Similarly, Fe-C alloy compositions with C content greater than 0.8wt% are termed as hypereutectoid steels. The microstructure of such steels consists of pro eutectoid Fe<sub>3</sub>C with lamellar pearlite.<br>
